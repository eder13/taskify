This is a full stack CRUD App realised with Spring Data REST, OAuth2 (Google) and React for learning purposes. The project was (partly) 
bootstrapped using [this template](https://github.com/eder13/Spring-Boot-OAuth2-React-Project-Template) - check it out if you need information to run a built on your local machine.

Possible Improvements for Learning: 

* Remove Redux Dev Tools in Production
* Use Thymeleaf for initial PageView
* Meta Tags and Sitemap
* Improve Checking Authentication Flow 
* Improve Webpack (HMR, webpack dev and webpack prod profiles)
* Switch to TypeScript
* Setup Service Worker
* Testing 
* Implement gzip compression (https://howtodoinjava.com/spring-boot2/rest/response-gzip-compression/)
* Switch from OAuth2 to password based Login (https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-registration)
